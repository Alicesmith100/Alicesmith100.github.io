        <p>
             Here you can see some of what Iâ€™ve learnt so far in my degree and though my own studying of web development:
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>
            Click <a href="TMA_M250.html">here</a> to see some <b>Java</b> that I have written in a TMA for <i>M250</i>
        </li>
            <br>
        <li>
            This is a TMA for <i>M256</i> where I've used <b>Java</b> (and possibly jQuery) to create a user interface to admit patients to a hospital
        </li>
            <br>
        <li>
            This is a video I created during my study of <i>T215</i> using <b>AvsP</b> and <b>Avisynth</b>, and <b>Audacity</b> to edit the sound
        </li>
            <br>
        <li>
            Here is a report I wrote for a TMA in <i>T215</i> on a comparison of fingerprint and iris biometric authentication systems
        </li>
            <br>
        <li>
            This is a screenshot of a website page showing visiting information for a made up theatre that I created in <b>Wordpress</b> for a TMA in <i>T215</i>
        </li>
        </ul>

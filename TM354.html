        An agile approach will always deliver better software than a plan-driven approach when it is used in a smaller project, because it is easier to manage, but not necessarily for a large project because without the documentation it is harder to spread out the workload. A plan-driven approach can be useful in a larger project because it has more traceability, which makes it easier to make changes down the line and also to make sure all the requirements have been met, however, the more involved the stakeholders are the less likely this is to happen. This means that an agile approach can be followed in a larger scale project as long as the stakeholders are involved throughout, then the software would be better than a plan-driven approach.

        The subscription system for WMG can be developed by an agile team because it is a project that is starting from scratch and it can be done quickly which would give the company an efficient software system to use in a shorter space of time. It can be said that agile methods do not scale up to larger systems but agile focuses on reducing the risks involved, such as failure and lack of communication, an issue with large scale projects.<br><br>
            
        An agile approach can help with timely delivery through better communication and collaboration among developers, with sprints, iterations of weeks not months, being strict on the amount of features that can be delivered and regular meetings to increase awareness of progress.<br><br>

        Agile approach helps with maintainability because it produces documents that are simple and easy to understand with a well-defined purpose. It keeps a balance between having enough documentation without creating too much and slowing the project down. <br><br>
            
        The approach the directors need to take toward the development team for the project to succeed is embrace the fact that the requirements will change during development and they should be under continuous review. They should be more engaged in the project after seeing working software delivered early and frequently, this should also increase the stakeholdersâ€™ trust (Segue Technologies, 2015).<br><br>

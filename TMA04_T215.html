<h3>Question 1</h3>

<h2>A Comparison of Fingerprint and Iris Biometric Authentication Systems</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
Introduction This report describes biometric authentication systems that Dynamic Holiday Limited may want to use to authenticate their customers, focusing on fingerprint and iris recognition systems. It also discusses the convenience, reliability and acceptability of the two technologies and then ends with a recommendation as to which would be most suitable for the holiday company.

Biometric authentications systems The word biometric comes from the Greek words bio and metron, which mean life and measure, meaning that biometric is a measurement of living things. Biometric authentication systems are computerised devices that use certain features of a human to verify that, that person is who they say they are. This can be done by using physiological characteristics, which are physical features, unlikely to change during a person’s life, such as a fingerprint. It can also be done by using behavioural characteristics, which are things a person does in the same fashion each time, such as the way they write their signature, these characteristics are also unlikely to change in a person’s lifetime. There are many different biometrics that are used for authentication today, some other physiological ones are iris patterns, facial features and personal odour. Some other behavioural biometrics are a person’s gait as they walk, the way someone logs into their computer and the way someone uses their voice.

The structure of biometric security systems can be seen in figure 1. The systems usually consist of the five components shown, these are a sensor, which captures the raw biometric data and a feature extractor, which creates a template from the raw data that holds a digital representation of the key features. They also have storage, which holds the templates, and a matcher, which compares the similarities between the input template with the templates already held in storage. Lastly, there is a decision maker, which decides whether the templates match based on the similarity value, which has the sensitivity of the value set based on certain predefined thresholds.

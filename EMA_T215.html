        <h2>VoIP: security issues and how they can be overcome</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        This report has been written to help the management at the private health clinic learn more about Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and how it works. It discusses some of the features VoIP provides, to help them decide whether to change the telephone facilities that they use from a traditional telephone network. It also includes the security concerns that have been written about in the article called ‘VoIP: voicing concerns’ by Bodhani (2011), that will be of interest to the management at the clinic, and some possible solutions to these security issues for the management to take into consideration. The report also mentions some on-going developments in the technology used to give devices on the internet addresses and how this will affect VoIP, and thus could affect the clinic in the future.
        </p>
        <h3>Description of VoIP</h3>
        <p>
        VoIP is a technology that was created back in 1995 to enable people to make telephone calls over the internet using Internet Protocol (IP) rather than using the traditional public switched telephone network (PSTN). It was originally created to reduce costs for long-distance international phone calls, but now, thanks to major advances in technology, it is used all around the world by companies and individual users alike.
        </p>
        <p>
        VoIP works by delivering voice transmissions over the internet as packets of digitised data routed from one IP address to another. The voice signal is compressed and then uncompressed at the receiving end. Some packets can be lost but it is usually undetectable to the human ear.
        </p>
        <p>
        Software such as Skype, the leading VoIP software, allows users to make phone calls from a computer to a phone, a phone to a phone and a computer to a computer at a much cheaper rate than a PSTN call and sometimes free. To do this the user on the computer needs a microphone and speakers, or a headset which connects via a USB port. The application’s user interface on the computer resembles a phone, it has numbers to click on for dialling and a display to show the person calling. The user’s telephone number is linked with their email account so they can use this number wherever they log into and any missed calls or voicemails can be sent as an email to the user’s email address.
        </p>
        <h3>Security concerns</h3>
        <p>
        The article by Bodhani (2011) talks about some of the security problems that surround VoIP. One of these problems is that important data might not be secure when using third party applications, as you cannot verify the company’s own privacy settings, the data may not be safe. This is due to VoIP using the public internet, which leaves it susceptible to viruses, and it is possible for an attacker to manipulate the software. This view is supported in the article

by Adam Boone, vice-president of product management at Sipera, who states that “the security requirements to protect VoIP are not the same as those used to protect other data applications”.
        </p>
        <p>
        Another security problem mentioned in the article is the possibility of criminals hacking into the phone system and taking control of it. The criminals can then use the system to generate large bills for the company by calling expensive international numbers. They can then sell the access to the phone line to their own customers to earn money for themselves, which can continue for a long period of time until the attack is detected. This type of attack is called toll fraud attack, and the 2011 Security Report by SecureLogix confirms that these attacks can be anything from relatively minor abuse to possible losses in excess of $100,000. SANs information security and computer forensic expert, Paul Henry states that “criminals find weaknesses in one area to gain access in another”. He believes that just 10% of organisations look at the security implications of VoIP, often finding that the data traffic is encrypted but the voice traffic is not. The hacker can also use the VoIP service to call premium rate numbers in countries like Latvia and North Korea, where there is little chance of legal action being taken against them, to gain money from the unsuspecting business.
        </p>
        <p>
        Along the route from one IP address to another the voice traffic can be disrupted by an attacker, they can also intercept the content and try to reconstruct it, this would be a breach of privacy and is another security issue mentioned in the article. Kassner (2014) states that eavesdropping is easier to do over VoIP compared to PSTN as physical access is not needed, and there are now free applications available that can reconstruct voice traffic into audio files, making eavesdropping even easier.
        </p>
        <p>
        All the issues mentioned above would be of particular concern to the private health clinic because of the great importance on information about patients being kept confidential. This might not be the case if the VoIP application’s privacy settings are not strong enough. The confidentiality is also at risk if the voice traffic gets intercepted. If this were to happen a hacker could gain enough information to conduct identity theft on the unsuspecting customer, potentially getting the customer to reveal their bank details, this would be a violation of privacy laws, which would be very damaging to the reputation of the business. If hackers were able to access the service and create large bills then this could be detrimental to the company and is another important concern for the clinic.
        </p>
        <p>
        One way to avoid these problems would be to monitor all calls and make sure all unusual activity is logged and investigated, this would mean that any calls being made by hackers would be spotted and stopped quickly, saving the business money. Staff should also be encouraged to have strong passwords and to change them regularly to help minimise the chance of a hacker gaining access. Another way would be to get staff trained on how to protect the company against VoIP attacks, such as eavesdropping. This could help avoid any breaches of privacy. A way that could potentially put a stop to all the security issues mentioned would be to use a virtual private network (VPN) to transfer the voice traffic over. This can be provided by software such as Powernet’s Vibe (Voice over Internet protocol Bandwidth Enhancer), which uses a VPN for the voice calls. It encrypts the data and prevents hackers from accessing the same server, which also keeps out any external traffic. This would protect the data from viruses and hackers, it would keep important data confidential and it would stop eavesdropping.</p>
        <h3>On-going developments in technology</h3>
        <p>
        IPv4 is a 32-bit addressing system for devices on the internet and it is the current version in use, it was once considered to have enough addresses available, but it was realised that with the growth in internet use a larger addressing system is needed. Since the mid-1990s IPv6 has been in development to take over from IPv4. It is currently being used alongside IPv4, with a possible cut off for IPv4 of 2020. IPv6 uses 128 bits, offering more than enough addresses, however, this affects VoIP because each address field on every packet will be four times larger. This will mean that the clinic will need anywhere from 10% to 46% more bandwidth for VoIP calling (Audin, 2013). This is partly due to VoIP using small packets to help guarantee quality of service, this means that if some packets are lost the quality should not be affected.
        </p>
        <p>
        As well as the additional cost for extra bandwidth, the clinic will also have to consider the costs of new hardware and software to support IPv6 alongside IPv4, this may influence the organisations decision to change to VoIP, however if they buy IPv6 ready software then it will just be a rise in bandwidth cost in the future that they will need to take into account.
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
        This report has explained that VoIP is a way of making phone calls over the internet that is cheaper than a PSTN line. It discusses how the software works, what hardware would be needed and how the software would appear on the screen. The report also mentions the security problems that are associated with VoIP, such as data not being secure, hackers taking control of the line and the content being intercepted, discussing how these would all be of particular concern to the clinic. It then goes on to suggest ways that these problems could be overcome, such as by monitoring all call activity, giving staff training on VoIP attacks and using a VPN. It finishes with a discussion into the on-going developments into IPv6 and how the larger address fields could result in an increased cost in bandwidth for the clinic.
